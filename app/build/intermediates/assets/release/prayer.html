<h2><b>Christian Prayers</b></h2>

<p>O God, the Strength of the weak, the Comfort of the sorrowful, the Friend of the lonely; let not sorrow overwhelm your children, nor anguish of heart turn them from you. Grant in the patience of hope they may continue in your service and in all godly living, until at length they also attain unto fullness of life before your face. <br>
    (Methodist Book of Offices, Words to Comfort, Words to Heal, p. 119).
    <br><br> Heavenly Father, you are intimately aware of the struggle I am experiencing – the pain and the despair. You know the desire of my heart to be healed of this illness. I ask now for your healing touch. I know you are able. You can heal me.
    I also understand that you will chose what is best for me. I pray that through this trial, I will draw close to you – that you will be my comfort and strength. I pray that ultimately, whatever happens, you will be glorified through me.<br>

<p>Lord look upon me with eyes of mercy, may your healing hand rest upon me, may your life-giving powers flow into every sell of my body and into the depths of my soul, cleansing, purifying, restoring me to wholeness and strength for service in your Kingdom.<br>

<h2><b>Buddhist Prayers</b></h2>
<p >Just as the soft rains fill the streams,
    Pour into the rivers and join together in the oceans,
    So may the power of every moment of your goodness
    Flow forth to awaken and heal all beings,
    Those here now, those gone before, those yet to come.
    By the power of every moment of your goodness
    May your heart’s wishes be soon fulfilled
    As magically as by a wish-fulfilling gem.
    By the power of every moment of your goodness
    May all dangers be averted and all disease be gone.
    May no obstacle come across your way.
    May you enjoy fulfillment and long life.
    For all in whose heart dwells respect,
    Who follow the wisdom and compassion of the Way,
    May your life prosper in the four blessings
    Of old age, beauty, happiness and strength.<br>

<p>May all beings everywhere plagued with sufferings of body and mind quickly be freed from their illness.
    May those frightened cease to be afraid, and may those bound be free.
    May the powerless find power, and may people think of befriending one another.
    May those who find themselves in trackless, fearful wilderness – the children, the aged, the unprotected – be guarded by beneficent celestials, and may they swiftly attain enlightenment.<br>

    I lift my eyes to the hills—where does my help come from?  My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.  He will not let your foot slip—He who watches over you will not slumber; Indeed, he who watches over you will neither slumber nor sleep.  The Lord watches over you—The Lord is your shade at your right hand.  The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.

<h2><b>Hindu Prayers</b></h2>

<p>
    O Father of the Earth, by fixed laws ruling,
    O Father of the Heavens, pray protect us,
    O Father of the great and shining Waters!
    What God shall we adore with our oblation?
    O Lord of creatures, Father of all beings,
    You alone pervade all that has come to birth.
    Grant us our heart’s desire for which we pray.
    May we become the Lords of many treasures!
    <br>
    -(Rig-Veda, The Vedic Experience, edited and translated by Raimundo Panikkar (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1977), p. 72.)
    <br><br>
    O almighty God, may my tongue be ever-blessed with the power of speech, may my nostrils be blessed with healthy and vital air, may my eyes be blessed with the perfect power of sight, ears with the perfect power of hearing, arms with strength, legs with vitality. May all the parts of my body be in perfect health.
    <br>
    -(The Hindu Prayer Book.)
    <br><br>
    Every thought of my mind, every emotion of my heart, every movement of my being, every feeling and every sensation, each cell of my body, each drop of my blood – all, all is yours, yours absolutely, yours without reserve, you can decide my life or my death, my happiness or my sorrow, pleasure or my pain. Whatever you do with me, whatever comes to me from you, will lead me to the Devine Rapture.
    <br>
    -(Bhagavata Purana, Book of Prayer, p. 68.)
